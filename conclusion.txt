You may not feel completely comfortable with Git at this point, which is normal. 
It’s a skill that you will get more comfortable with as you use it.

The main thing to take away from this lesson is the basic workflow. The commands 
you’ve learned here are the ones you will be using the most often with Git.

Don’t worry if you don’t know all the commands yet or if they aren’t quite sticking in
your memory yet. They will soon be seared into your brain as you use them over and over
in future Odin projects.
